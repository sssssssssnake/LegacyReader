        Hello, If you see this, then that means that you need to allow the app to access your storage (or you\'ve
        started the app for the first time).
        Please restart the app in the former case, and a setting popup will appear. Then proceed to select the allow option.
        Once the permissions have been handled, this message will disappear on subsequent startups.
        \n


        The reasoning behind this is such that you will be able to store, manage, and use the files you have correctly.
        We will copy your files into the Downloads folder for you under the name of the app.
        Please do not edit the folder, but once you have selected your files, feel free to remove them from their
        original location.
        \n




        Thank you for using LegacyReader.
